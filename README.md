# IttyBitz

This is a client-side file and text encryption tool built with Next.js and Firebase Studio.

## Core Features

- **Client-Side Encryption/Decryption:** All cryptographic operations happen in your browser. Your files and secrets are never sent to a server.
- **File & Text Support:** Encrypt and decrypt both files and text snippets.
- **Password & Key File Protection:** Secure your data with a password, an optional key file, or both for an added layer of security.
- **No Accounts Required:** Works entirely without user accounts or sign-ins.

To get started, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx` and the main component at `src/components/encryptor-tool.tsx`.
