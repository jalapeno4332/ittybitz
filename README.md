## ‚öôÔ∏è Core features

Here‚Äôs what you can do with IttyBitz:
- **Client-side encryption/decryption**: all cryptographic operations happen in your browser. Your files and secrets are never sent to a server.
- **Password & key file protection**: secure your data with a strong password, an optional key file, or both for an added layer of security.
- **File & text support**: encrypt and decrypt both files and text snippets.
- **No accounts required**: works entirely without user accounts or signins.

<br/>

## ü•§ How to Use IttyBitz

At the top, you‚Äôll find two simple tabs:  **Encrypt üîí**  and **Decrypt üîë**

- In **Encrypt** mode, you can lock away a file or a text snippet with a password, a key file, or both.

| Encrypting a file | Encrypting text |
|---	|---	|
|	1.	Select the Encrypt tab.|	1.	Select the Encrypt tab.|

## üõ°Ô∏èSecurity features

The security of your data is the highest priority. Here is a summary of the security measures built into IttyBitz:

- **Client-Side operations:** all encryption and decryption processes happen entirely within your browser. Your password, key files, and secret data are **never** transmitted over the internet or stored on any server.

- **Strong encryption standard:** IttyBitz uses **AES-256-GCM**, which is the standard for symmetric encryption recommended by the NSA for Top Secret information. It provides both confidentiality and data integrity.
- **Strong key derivation:** your password is not used directly as the encryption key. Instead, it is run through the **PBKDF2** (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) algorithm with **1,000,000 iterations**. This makes brute-force attacks against your password extremely slow and computationally expensive, even for weak passwords.
- **Cryptographically secure randomness:** the application uses `window.crypto.getRandomValues()` to generate the salt for key derivation, the Initialization Vector (IV) for AES-GCM, and the random characters for the password generator. This is a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) that is suitable for security-sensitive applications.
- **Password strength indicator:** to encourage strong security practices, the UI provides real-time feedback, guiding users to create passwords that are at least 24 characters long and contain a mix of character types.
- **Secure memory handling:** after an encryption or decryption operation is complete, the application code makes an explicit effort to overwrite sensitive variables (like the derived key and salt) in memory, reducing the window of opportunity for sophisticated memory-scraping attacks.
- **No user tracking:** the application does not use cookies, analytics, or trackers. Your activity is your own.

## üíª  Ittybitz - Local Setup Instructions

For maximum security when handling sensitive data like seed phrases, you can run ittybitz locally on your own machine.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org))

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jalapeno4332/ittybitz.git
   cd ittybitz
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build and run the application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   - Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000`

5. **To Stop the App**
   - When you're done using IttyBitz, return to your terminal and press Ctrl+C to stop the server.

### Security Notes

- ‚úÖ **Open Source**: All code is auditable and transparent
- ‚úÖ **Offline Operation**: Works completely offline after initial setup
- ‚úÖ **No External Dependencies**: All cryptographic operations happen locally
- ‚úÖ **Air-Gap Compatible**: Can be run on isolated machines

**For handling high-value secrets**, consider:
- Running on an air-gapped machine
- Auditing the source code before use
- Using the production build for better performance

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed: `node --version`
2. Clear dependencies and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
3. Check that no other services are using port 3000
